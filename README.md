# Employee Tracker

## Task

Create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```
npm start || node app.js
```
